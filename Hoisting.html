    <h4>Variable Declarations</h4>
    <p>Hoisting is the default behaviour of JavaScript where all the variables and functions declarations are moved to
        the top.<br>
        JavaScript engine runs through our code in two phases â€” the Creation Phase and the Execution Phase. In the first
        (Creation) phase, the engine goes through the code and allocates memory for the variables.
        <br>
        In the same phase, the variables declared via var are assigned the value undefined and that is why in the below
        code snippet you will get the value of the variable firstname as undefined.
    </p>
    <p>In the case of the variables declared via let and const, they are also allocated memory but they are not assigned
        the value undefined initially i.e. variable declarations do hoist but they throw an error till initialized</p>
    <h5>To avoid hoisting in JavaScript, the strict mode can be used.</h5>
    <script>

        console.log(x);
        var x = 1;
        console.log(x);

        // console.log(xy);
        // let xy = 1;
        // console.log(xy);

        console.log(xyz);
        const xyz = 1;
        console.log(xyz);

    </script>

    <h4>Hoisting in Functions</h4>
    <p>Hoisting in functions works the same way with the only notable exception that function declarations are hoisted
        but not function expressions. </p>


    <script>
        hello();
        // Function declaration
        function hello() {
            console.log("hello");
        }
        hello();

        sayHello();
        // Function expression
        var sayHello = function () {
            console.log("sayhello");
        }
        sayHello();

    </script>


    <script>
        "use strict";
        myFunction();

        function myFunction() {
            y = 3.14;   // This will cause an error (y is not defined)
        }

    </script>
