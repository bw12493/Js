    <h5>Closure</h5>
    <p>A closure can be defined as a JavaScript feature in which the inner function has access to the outer function
        variable.</p>
    <p>Function bundled with its lexical environment(A lexical environment is a data structure that holds identifier-variable mapping) is known as a closure. Whenever function is returned, even if its vanished in execution context but still it remembers the reference it was pointing to.</p>

        // outer function
        function naam(name){
            //inner function
            //debugger;
            function displayName(){
                console.log("Hi"+" "+ name);
