    <p>Object is collection of key-value pair</p>
    <p>
      1 - Every JavaScript object has a Prototype property, Which makes
      inheritance possible; It should be object and Not Primitative data should
      be assigned to it
    </p>
    <p>
      2 - when certain method or propery is called, search get start from object
      itself, And if can not found, search moves in to the object Prototype,
      procces continues untill method is found That is called as Prototype
      Chain. Else Undefined
    </p>
    <p>
      The Object constructor creates an object wrapper for the given value. If
      the value is null or undefined , it will create and return an empty
      object. Otherwise, it will return an object of a Type that corresponds to
      the given value.
