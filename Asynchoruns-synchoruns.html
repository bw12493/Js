    <h4>Synchoruns</h4>
    <p>Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation is dependent on the completion of the one before it.</p>

        let secondcall = ()=>{
            console.log("second call")
        }

            console.log('firstcall');
            secondcall();
            console.log('first ++');

    <h4>Asynchronus </h4>
    <p>Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. </p>
    <p>It has callback so it will go through Event Loop (Response, Error is also callback)</p>
